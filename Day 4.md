# Day 4: Conditional Rendering, Component Lifecycle & Optimization

## Goal
Master techniques for conditionally rendering content and displaying lists of data in React components. Understand the React component lifecycle and optimization techniques.

## Resources
- [React Official Docs: Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
- [React Official Docs: Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
- [MDN Web Docs: Conditional Rendering in React](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_conditionally_rendering)
- [freeCodeCamp YouTube: React Lifecycle Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rHfIDdIPsc)

## Tasks
1. Learn about the different phases of the React component lifecycle (mounting, updating, unmounting).
2. Explore techniques to improve the performance of your React applications, like using `shouldComponentUpdate` and `memoization`.
3. Consider performance implications while building your components.
4. Implement performance optimizations in a sample project.
5. Share your progress on LinkedIn/X with #React7DayChallenge and tag Code Social.
