# Day 7-12 (Optional): Project Day

## Goal
Attend two specially curated Project Sessions where you can ask questions, clear your doubts, and learn how React is implemented in real-world projects. Put your new skills to the test by building a simple React application. You can choose from various ideas, such as a to-do list app, a weather app, or a basic photo gallery.
